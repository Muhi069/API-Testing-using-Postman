# API-Testing

API TESTING is a software testing type that validates Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The purpose of API Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs(keyboard) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the systemâ€™s response.

HOW API TESTING WITH POSTMAN WORKS:

1. Download and Install POSTMAN on your local machine
2. Open POSTMAN
3. Create a new Collection
4. Add a new Request (this will be your http request)
5. Copy the request URL from dummy API Testing site (e.g: reqres.in)
6. Paste the URL on the request's url field and select the correct request sending method.
7. Save the file and then click the 'SEND' button to see the response from the website. 

You can follow this step if you want to do it from the scratch. 
Or, you can simple import an existing Collection file and Run it to how POSTMAN works with the requests.

Thanks.
